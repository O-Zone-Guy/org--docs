* Introduction

  This page is based of my own experience and Stroustrup's book [[http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html]["C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)]]".

* Language basics

  It is statically typed; the type of every entity must be known to the compiler at compile time. There is no ambiguity about what the type of variable or the signature of any function.

  Stroustrup insists that C++ is a many paradigm language and we would be doing it injustice by calling it an OO language. To fully utilise C++ you need to understand that it has many paradigms that can be used simultaneously.

  C++ is a compiled language. The text file is taken and processed, producing object files, which are linked then yielding an executable.
